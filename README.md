# 🚧 **System Under Construction: Face Detection Web Application** 🚧

## Executive Summary

The **Face Detection Website** is a prototype web-based application engineered with **Python**, **Flask**, and **OpenCV**, designed to perform automated **facial recognition and localization** within digital images. 🖼️🔍 Users are enabled to submit images via a structured web interface, upon which the system algorithmically detects facial regions and renders bounding rectangles around them.

⚠️ **Notice:** This platform is presently in its **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) / developmental phase**. Functionalities are operational at a preliminary level; however, further refinement, scalability enhancements, and security reinforcements are ongoing. Stakeholders and contributors are invited to submit **recommendations, feedback, and upgrade proposals** to facilitate optimization of the system.

## 🔧 Core Features

* 📤 Image upload capability via a secure web form.
* 🤖 Face detection powered by **OpenCV’s Haar Cascade classifier**.
* 🖼️ Visualization of processed images with detected faces highlighted.
* 🎨 Lightweight, minimalistic, and user-oriented interface.

## 📂 Project Architecture

* **`app.py`** → Principal Flask application containing routing and detection logic.
* **`templates/index.html`** → Frontend HTML template for the user interface.
* **`requirements.txt`** → Dependency specification file (Python libraries).
* **`uploads/`** → Temporary storage directory for raw user-submitted images *(excluded from Git)*.
* **`static/detected/`** → Repository for algorithmically processed images *(excluded from Git)*.
* **`.gitignore`** → Exclusion rules for version control hygiene.

## ⚙️ Installation & Configuration

1. **Repository Cloning:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Virtual Environment Setup (Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv face_detection_env
   face_detection_env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   source face_detection_env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   ```

3. **Dependency Installation:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## ▶️ Deployment & Execution

Activate the Flask development server via:

```bash
python app.py
```

Access the system at **[http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)** using any modern browser.

---

## 📌 Usage Protocol

* Navigate to the homepage and upload an image in supported formats (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`).
* The system will process the file, detect facial landmarks, and present the annotated image.
* Uploaded and processed assets are retained locally in `uploads/` and `static/detected/`.

## ⚠️ Developmental Status

This application remains **under active construction**:

* 🔄 Expanded algorithmic models (beyond Haar Cascade) are being integrated.
* 🔒 Security hardening and production-grade deployment pipelines are in progress.
* 🛠️ Cross-platform scalability, real-time streaming detection, and API endpoints are under development.

We **welcome ideas, improvements, and collaborative contributions** to advance this MVP into a **robust production-ready system**. 🚀
